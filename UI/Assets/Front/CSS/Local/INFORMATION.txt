What is local styles?
Styles in this folder will get loaded only for plugin scope. That means, that they will only be loaded
if they are enqueued in specific plugin template file.

NOTES:
1. There is no need to have a separate file for RTL classes/images. PHP does process that by giving an additional rtl body class name.
Then it is super easy to handle all that in same CSS file as non-rtl, just by using that prefix when needed.
