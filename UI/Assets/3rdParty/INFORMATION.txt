What is the purpose of ""/3rdParty/" assets (a.k.a. "Vendor assets") folder,
and why the 3rd party assets are not a part of regular asset folders?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answer is simple:
1. Continuous integration - your 3rd party assets should be related by ZERO LINKS to your code.
Or at least have a minimum links as possible. Then you can just drag-and-drop the new 3rd party assets version
or update that 3rd party asset folder via Source control (i.e. "Git Pull").

2. Versioning - you always want to be up-to-date with the last version of your 3rd party assets if you can.
By having your 3rd party assets in a separate folder you will never have to bother if the structure of 3rd party
is the same or it is changed, as long as you keep the entry point file name the same
(or re-link it in your main code after upgrade - this is a rare situation if your vendor scripts
does NOT have version suffix in they entry point file name).
